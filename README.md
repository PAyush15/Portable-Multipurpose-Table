# Portable-Multipurpose-Table
Universal table for all your needs

Design files in .f3d and .stp format have been attached.

Also, we did load analysis(simulation) of the table in Fusion360 simulation workspace, by applying 80kg load on 4 sides of bench(for sitting) and it gave acceptable factor of safety of above 6. Although, this value might slightly decrease depending on the change in material but it stays in the acceptable range. Images for the same have been attached.

Also, extra renders of the table have been attached demonstarting different positions and angles. In one such configuration, the legs remain folded and bench on the ground as shown in img1. This can be done when one wants to sit down with legs spread wide and dine on do other stuff on the table, whilst sitting on the ground.

PPT for the presentation has been also been attached in PDF form as the PDF was created with custom fonts.
